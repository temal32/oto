<h2>Why does my Anti-virus flag OT-Optimizer as dangerous?</h2>
<p>In order to make OTO accessible to everyone, it has been bundled into an .exe file, which can be run on any Windows computer without the need to install Python. While this has made the tool more accessible, it has also resulted in some concerns related to its safety and security.

One of the most common concerns related to OTO is that it is an unrecognized, unofficial file. As a result, Windows Defender and other anti-virus programs may flag it as a form of malware. However, it is important to note that this is a false positive, and OTO is completely safe and free from any harmful software that could potentially harm the user's computer.

Another reason why OTO is sometimes flagged by anti-virus programs is that it changes system and game settings. This can cause some anti-virus programs to raise an alert, as such changes can be associated with malicious activity. However, it is important to note that OTO only modifies settings that are relevant to improving system and game performance. The changes are completely safe and do not pose any threat to the user's computer or personal data.

At the same time, the team behind OTO is constantly working to contact anti-virus companies to whitelist and remove their false positive detections on the tool. This requires time and effort, as it involves establishing communication with the companies and providing them with the necessary information and evidence to demonstrate that OTO is a safe and legitimate tool.
Despite the challenges, the team has been successful in contacting some anti-virus companies, such as Avast, MalwareBytes, and Fortiguard, who have already removed their false positive detections on OTO. This is a positive sign that demonstrates the team's commitment to ensuring the safety and security of OTO, and their willingness to work with anti-virus companies to address any concerns and issues related to the tool.

In conclusion, while there may be concerns related to OTO's safety and security, it is important to note that it is a completely safe and legitimate tool. The team behind OTO is constantly working to address any false positive detections raised by anti-virus programs, and they are committed to ensuring that the tool is accessible and beneficial to users without posing any risks or threats. With its range of performance optimization features and commitment to safety and security, OTO is an excellent choice for users looking to improve their system and gaming performance.</p>
