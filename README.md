<h2>Is OT-Optimizer safe?</h2>
<p>One of the most common concerns that people have when downloading software tools is whether they are safe to use or not. In the case of OT-Optimizer, it is important to note that it is a 100% safe program that has been carefully designed and developed to ensure the highest level of safety and security for its users.

One of the key factors that contribute to the safety of OTO is the fact that it is 100% written by the developer. This means that nobody else can modify or change the code behind the program, ensuring its integrity and safety. The developer has gone to great lengths to ensure that the code behind OTO is secure, and that there are no known vulnerabilities that could be exploited by hackers or malicious actors.

Additionally, OTO is a fully open-source program that is available on Github, a platform for software developers to share and collaborate on projects. The open-source nature of the program means that users can access the source code of the program and review it for themselves, ensuring transparency and accountability. This also means that developers from all over the world can collaborate on the program, providing feedback, suggestions, and even contributions to the codebase.

Another reason why OTO is 100% safe is that it has been thoroughly tested for viruses and other forms of malware. The developer has put in place a range of measures to ensure that the program is free from any harmful software that could potentially harm the user's computer. This includes regular virus scans and adherence to industry best practices for software development.

In conclusion, OTO is a 100% safe. The fact that it is 100% written by the developer and available on Github means that users can be confident in its safety and transparency. With its range of performance optimization features and ease of use, it is an excellent choice for gamers and computer users looking to improve their system's performance while ensuring their safety and security.</p>
<h2>Why does my Anti-virus flag OT-Optimizer as dangerous?</h2>
<p>In order to make OTO accessible to everyone, it has been bundled into an .exe file, which can be run on any Windows computer without the need to install Python. While this has made the tool more accessible, it has also resulted in some concerns related to its safety and security.

One of the most common concerns related to OTO is that it is an unrecognized, unofficial file. As a result, Windows Defender and other anti-virus programs may flag it as a form of malware. However, it is important to note that this is a false positive, and OTO is completely safe and free from any harmful software that could potentially harm the user's computer.

Another reason why OTO is sometimes flagged by anti-virus programs is that it changes system and game settings. This can cause some anti-virus programs to raise an alert, as such changes can be associated with malicious activity. However, it is important to note that OTO only modifies settings that are relevant to improving system and game performance. The changes are completely safe and do not pose any threat to the user's computer or personal data.

At the same time, the team behind OTO is constantly working to contact anti-virus companies to whitelist and remove their false positive detections on the tool. This requires time and effort, as it involves establishing communication with the companies and providing them with the necessary information and evidence to demonstrate that OTO is a safe and legitimate tool.
Despite the challenges, the team has been successful in contacting some anti-virus companies, such as Avast, MalwareBytes, and Fortiguard, who have already removed their false positive detections on OTO. This is a positive sign that demonstrates the team's commitment to ensuring the safety and security of OTO, and their willingness to work with anti-virus companies to address any concerns and issues related to the tool.

In conclusion, while there may be concerns related to OTO's safety and security, it is important to note that it is a completely safe and legitimate tool. The team behind OTO is constantly working to address any false positive detections raised by anti-virus programs, and they are committed to ensuring that the tool is accessible and beneficial to users without posing any risks or threats. With its range of performance optimization features and commitment to safety and security, OTO is an excellent choice for users looking to improve their system and gaming performance.</p>
<h2>Does OT-Optimizer collect personal data?</h2>
<p>At present, OT-Optimizer is programmed to collect some anonymous data, provided that you allow OTO to do so. When you first launch OTO, it will request your permission to collect anonymous data and continue processing them. If you do not wish for OTO to gather any anonymous data, you can simply decline. In the event that you have previously consented to the collection of anonymous data and wish to withdraw your permission, you can create a ticket in our discord server, and we will guide you through the necessary steps to revoke the collection of anonymous data.

However, if you wish to decline your agreement on your own, you can follow these steps:

1. Open OT-Optimizer
2. In the menu, enter the number 5 to erase all associated files with OTO. (If it prompts you to delete backup files as well, press Y)
3. After the process, your agreement to collect anonymous data will be revoked, and OTO will not continue processing any data until you consent again.

If you prefer to decline your agreement without opening OTO again or without deleting OTO backup files, you need to follow these steps:

1. Open your Windows Explorer application
2. Navigate to the main local disk path where your Windows is installed (usually C).
3. Find the subfolder "OTO". The path you are now in may look something like "C:\OTO".
4. Either change the content of the OTO_agreed.txt file to "False" or simply delete the file.
5. After these steps, your agreement to collect anonymous data will be revoked, and OTO will not continue processing any data until you consent again.

It is important to note that OT-Optimizer only collects anonymous data and error reports to improve the product. We will never sell your data or engage in any similar activity. Your data will be sent to a webhook, which then forwards the collected information to a private discord server where only the developer (that is, me, Temal) can view it.

In terms of the type of anonymous data that OT-Optimizer collects, the following are examples (but not limited to):

- The current version of OTO that you are using (e.g., "2.5").
- The first letters of your Windows username in an encrypted version (e.g., "5eaa9acecc370aa14860af462e7cda39").
- The current timestamp (i.e., when you opened OTO, such as 11:30pm).
- The single drive letter of your main disk where Windows is installed (usually "C").
- The current Windows system version.
- Python error reports.

We take your privacy seriously, and we are committed to being transparent about the data we collect and how we use it to improve OT-Optimizer. If you have any concerns or questions regarding data collection, please do not hesitate to reach out to us via Discord (Temal#3818).</p>
